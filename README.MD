09/08/23 - I am taking a temporary or potentially permanent break from this project to relearn previous concepts and potentially build a similar project to the chess game in the future. I am doing this to assure I can keep core programming knowledge such as but not limited to APIs, CRUD concepts, OOP, etc.
